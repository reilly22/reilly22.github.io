          At Purdue, I’m studying Industrial Engineering. My coursework has focused on business and data analytics, data visualization, and engineering applications in a business setting. My main interests lie somewhere at the intersection of business and data science, using both to make intelligent decisions to meet the short & long-term goals of a company.

        When I’m not occupied with academics & work, I can be found singing in a choral ensemble, drinking too much coffee, roadtripping, or planning my next trip.
